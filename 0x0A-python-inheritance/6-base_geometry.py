Module: base_geometry

This module defines the BaseGeometry class, which serves as
a base class for geometry-related operations.

Classes:
- BaseGeometry
    A base class for geometry operations. It provides a placeholder
    method for 'area', which should be implemented
    by derived classes.

Methods:
- BaseGeometry.area(self)
    Raises an exception indicating that the 'area' method is not
    implemented. This method serves as a placeholder
    for subclasses to provide their own implementation.

Note: This module provides a foundation for more
specific geometry-related classes.
